# Fortinet-Assessment

This project correspond to my response to the following Fortinet assessement subject.

## Subject

Let's say you manage the pet store website and you want to ensure that the application programming interface (API) endpoints is secure.

You will focus on the following URLs:

- POST /v2/store/order
- GET /v2/store/order/{orderId}
- DELETE /v2/store/order/{orderId}

1. Provide an efficient and easy-to-use python code that queries these URLs and parameters.
2. List common vulnerabilities that these API endpoints may contain.
3. Propose tests to detect if these vulnerabilities exists on these endpoints.

The documentation of the API is the below one:  
[https://petstore.swagger.io/](https://petstore.swagger.io/)
